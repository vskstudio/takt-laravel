# vskstudio/takt-laravel

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Route redaction. `redact_routes` (`TAKT_REDACT_ROUTES`) lists sensitive routes
  sent as their pattern instead of the real path (`/verify/abc` becomes
  `/verify/{token}`), and `route_templates` (`TAKT_ROUTE_TEMPLATES`) sends every
  page as its Laravel route template, read from the matched route of the current
  request. Both apply to the `@takt` snippet, where they require `mode: sdk`,
  and to the `Takt` facade: the current route template becomes the default
  `route` of `pageview()` and `event()`, which also accept an explicit `route`.
- The `SnippetRenderer` binding is now `scoped` instead of `singleton`, so the
  rendered snippet follows the current request under long-lived workers.
- Requires `vskstudio/takt-core-php` 0.6.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- `TAKT_ENDPOINT` no longer means two different things depending on the code path.
  It fed both the browser snippet, which expects the full collect URL, and the
  server-side sender, which expects an origin it appends `/api/event` to — so the
  shipped default (`https://taktlytics.com`) made the browser post to the service
  root, while the full URL form (`https://taktlytics.com/api/event`) made the
  server post to `/api/event/api/event`. Both forms are now normalised on read to
  whatever each path needs, so every existing configuration keeps working and both
  paths agree. A value carrying any other path (a same-origin first-party proxy
  such as `/collect`) is still used verbatim.
- Docs: the accepted `endpoint` forms are spelled out in the README and the
  published config file; the container bindings are documented with their real
  scope (`SnippetRenderer` is a singleton, `Takt` is `scoped`, not a singleton);
  the `Takt` facade docblock now carries the full `event()`/`pageview()`
  signatures.

Releases before 0.5.1 are documented in the repository's git tags.
