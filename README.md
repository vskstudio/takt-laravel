# Takt for Laravel

Laravel integration for [Takt](https://github.com/vskstudio) analytics. Drop a single `@takt`
Blade directive in your layout for privacy-friendly client-side tracking, and use the `Takt`
facade to send server-side events straight from your application code.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel 10, 11, or 12

## Installation

```bash
composer require vskstudio/takt-laravel
```

The service provider and the `Takt` facade are registered automatically through Laravel package
auto-discovery. There is nothing else to wire up.

## Configuration

The package ships with sane defaults and reads everything from your environment. To customise the
published config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=takt-config
```

This writes `config/takt.php`. All values are environment-driven:

| Env variable             | Default                     | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `TAKT_DOMAIN`            | `''`                        | The site/domain registered in Takt that data is attributed to.           |
| `TAKT_ENDPOINT`          | `https://taktlytics.com`    | Where events are collected. Defaults to the hosted Takt origin. Both the service origin (`https://taktlytics.com`) and the full collect URL (`https://taktlytics.com/api/event`) are accepted and behave identically — see [Endpoint](#endpoint). |
| `TAKT_SCRIPT_ORIGIN`     | `null`                      | First-party origin to serve the tracker + derive the endpoint from (`{origin}/api/event`) — a custom domain you proxy through to dodge ad-blockers (endpoint wins over it). |
| `TAKT_API_KEY`           | `null`                      | Ingest-scoped API key used for server-side events (see below).           |
| `TAKT_MODE`              | `inline`                    | Snippet delivery mode: `inline`, `cdn`, `asset`, or `sdk` (full ES-module `init()`, required for `TAKT_SCRUB_URL`). |
| `TAKT_OUTBOUND`          | `false`                     | Track clicks on outbound links.                                          |
| `TAKT_FILES`            | `false`                     | Track file download clicks.                                              |
| `TAKT_FILE_EXTENSIONS`   | `''`                        | Comma-separated extensions to count as downloads (e.g. `pdf,zip,docx`). Empty keeps the tracker's default list. |
| `TAKT_TAGGED`            | `false`                     | Track elements tagged in HTML with `data-takt-event`.                    |
| `TAKT_NOT_FOUND`         | `false`                     | Track 404 pageviews.                                                      |
| `TAKT_EXCLUDE_LOCALHOST` | `true`                      | Skip tracking when running on localhost.                                 |
| `TAKT_NONCE`             | `null`                      | CSP nonce for the inline `<script>` (request-scoped — see config notes). |
| `TAKT_SAMPLE_RATE`       | `null`                      | Sample a fraction of hits, e.g. `0.5` keeps ~50%. Unset tracks everything. |
| `TAKT_TRACK_QUERY`       | `null`                      | Keep the raw query string + hash in tracked URLs (default strips them).  |
| `TAKT_QUERY_PARAMS`      | `''`                        | Comma-separated query params to keep when `TAKT_TRACK_QUERY` is off (e.g. `utm_source,utm_medium`). |
| `TAKT_EXCLUDE`           | `''`                        | Comma-separated path prefixes never tracked (e.g. `/app,/account`). Requires `TAKT_MODE=sdk`; segment-bounded. |
| `TAKT_RESPECT_DNT`       | `null`                      | Set to `false` to stop honoring the browser Do-Not-Track header.        |
| `TAKT_ENABLED`           | `null`                      | Kill-switch: set to `false` to disable tracking entirely.               |
| `TAKT_SCRUB_URL`         | `null`                      | Raw JS function to rewrite URLs before sending, e.g. `(u) => u.split('#')[0]`. **Requires `TAKT_MODE=sdk` and is dev-controlled only** — it is injected verbatim into the page; never build it from user input. |

Example `.env`:

```dotenv
TAKT_DOMAIN=example.com
TAKT_API_KEY=ingest_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TAKT_MODE=inline
```

### Endpoint

`TAKT_ENDPOINT` feeds two code paths at once: the browser snippet, which needs the full collect
URL, and the server-side sender, which needs the origin it appends `/api/event` to. Both forms are
therefore accepted and normalised for you, so these two settings are equivalent:

```dotenv
TAKT_ENDPOINT=https://taktlytics.com
TAKT_ENDPOINT=https://taktlytics.com/api/event
```

A value carrying any other path is taken as the collect URL verbatim — that is the case for a
same-origin first-party proxy (`TAKT_ENDPOINT=/collect`) used to dodge ad-blockers. Leave it unset
to talk to the hosted Takt service.

Takt itself is a managed service hosted in Europe; only the `/takt.js` measurement script can be
served from your own domain (see `asset` mode and `TAKT_SCRIPT_ORIGIN`).

## Client-side tracking

Add the `@takt` directive to the `<head>` of your layout:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    @takt
</head>
<body>
    @yield('content')
</body>
</html>
```

### Delivery modes

`TAKT_MODE` controls how the tracking script is delivered:

- **`inline`** (default) — the script is embedded directly in the rendered HTML. Zero extra
  network requests, nothing to host.
- **`cdn`** — references the script from jsDelivr (`@vskstudio/takt-core`).
- **`asset`** — references a copy of the script served by your own application from
  `/takt/takt.auto.js` (prefixed with `TAKT_SCRIPT_ORIGIN` when set).
- **`sdk`** — loads the full SDK as an ES module and boots it with `init()`. Required for
  `TAKT_SCRUB_URL` (custom URL rewriting), which cannot be expressed as a data attribute.

## Server-side events

Use the `Takt` facade to record events from controllers, jobs, or anywhere in your application:

```php
use Vskstudio\Takt\Laravel\Facades\Takt;
use Vskstudio\Takt\Revenue;

// A custom event with properties and revenue
Takt::event('Signup', ['plan' => 'pro'], new Revenue('29.00', 'EUR'));

// A simple pageview
Takt::pageview();
```

Server-side events automatically attribute to the current request's IP address and User-Agent, so
they are correlated with the visitor that triggered them. Both methods accept an explicit URL and
referrer as their last arguments (`event(name, props, revenue, url, referrer)`,
`pageview(url, referrer)`).

> **API key scope:** `TAKT_API_KEY` must be an **ingest-scoped** key bound to the configured
> `TAKT_DOMAIN`. Keep it server-side only — it is never exposed to the browser.

## Container bindings

The service provider registers exactly two services:

| Service                        | Binding     | Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Vskstudio\Takt\SnippetRenderer` | `singleton` | Built once from config; resolved by the `@takt` Blade directive. Rebind it per request if you need a fresh CSP nonce. |
| `Vskstudio\Takt\Takt`            | `scoped`    | Backs the `Takt` facade. **Not** a singleton: it captures the current request's IP/User-Agent, so it is rebuilt on each request scope and never leaks attribution across requests under long-lived workers such as Octane. |
